## Hello, I’m **Sora NAGANO**.

I am a Japanese graduate student specializing in the **theoretical analysis of linguistic data** and the **processing of language data** using **phonological theory** and **machine learning**.

With a keen interest in **data science**, my focus lies in **phonological data**, which diverges somewhat from popular natural language processing (morpho-syntactic processes).
